{"name":"Webbings","tagline":"HTML5 Canvas illustration of flying insects","body":"# 2D Illustration of Swarm-based Insect Mating\r\n\r\n Swarm-based mating of insects, such as midges, typically involves\r\n  groups, predominantly of males, centred over some marker in the\r\n  terrain. Swarming increases the chances of a successful encounter with\r\n  patrolling females that are attracted to the swarm. They enter it\r\n  briefly, mate in flight, and eventually drop from the swarm to lay\r\n  eggs elsewhere, and then expire. During this winged phase, the insects\r\n  do not feed, so their lifetimes depend on their internal resources.\r\n\r\n  This code gives a biologically plausible illustration of these\r\n  features using the basic 2D-physics of interacting, identical\r\n  particles. The male/female attraction is an adjustable inverse-square\r\n  law, reflecting the acoustic communication used in nature. We use an\r\n  adjustable linear law for the attraction to a swarm marker. Male/male\r\n  attraction, which is thought not to be a big factor in the swarm, is\r\n  here turned off by default, but can be added as an adjustable\r\n  inverse-square law.  (Above a critical strength of this attraction, \r\n  mob clustering will occur in the swarm.) Self-propulsion is\r\n  accounted for by setting a minimum velocity in the swarm. The maximum\r\n  velocity is adjustable. Ageing is accumulated individually for the\r\n  particles from the number of flight maneuvers made--matings, take-offs\r\n  from ground, and close encounters. These details are fixed but the\r\n  maximum lifetime of a particle is adjustable. Expired or egg-laying\r\n  females drop from the swarm and disappear from the scene. Expired\r\n  males collect as debris around the marker.\r\n\r\n  The code is fully self-contained HTML5/CSS3 JS Canvas, and is compatible with\r\n  up-to-date browsers that support rAF animation. Chrome/Safari seem to work best. Performance depends on the\r\n  hardware.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
